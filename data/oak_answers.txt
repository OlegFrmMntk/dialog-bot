So, you decided to show up after all?
You want to get your Pokemon?
You look like you are ready for bed. Not a pokemon trainer. I hope you don’t think you are going to train in your pajamas. What pokemon do you want?
Already taken by someone who was on time.
That one was also taken by a kid who wasn’t late.
The early bird gets the worm or in this case, the Pokemon.
Well, there is still one left, but I think I should warn you. There is a problem with this last one.
Well, in that case. You are welcome! Your Pokemon - Pikachu!
